# Welcome to the Pokedex!

This is my first attempt to make a terminal app in Go.
I'm still learning the basics of making HTTP requests, setting up a cache, and decoding JSON.

## Usage:

help: Displays a help message
map: Displays the next 20 area locations in the Pokemon world
mapb: Displays the last 20 area locations in the Pokemon world
explore: Displays list of Pokemon in map area. Syntax: explore $AREA_NAME
catch: Attempt to catch a Pokemon. Syntax: catch $POKEMON_NAME
